# portfolio-in-react

## Description

Much like we had to revisit a blog site with new tools, we were tasked once again with rebuilding our portfolio site with new tools. Only this time, the importance was a little more amplifed as React was the name of the game. With this, we'll be knocking on the doors of companies, showing them the things that we're capable of, and hoping they'll take us on for work.

## Usage

It's a single page application, with the About Me as the default section. There's a contact page, the all important portfolio page, and a resume that can be readily downloaded.
